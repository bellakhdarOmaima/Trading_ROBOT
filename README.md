# Trading_ROBOT

Trading is a term we've been hearing frequently, often associated with high risks. But what if there was an automated robot that could track market trends, buy and sell at optimal times, and minimize risks? This project was inspired by the exciting possibility of creating such a system using machine learning techniques.

In this project, I take you through the journey of Creating an Automated Trading Robot Using Machine Learning.

**Project Overview**

This project involved three main stages:

1️⃣**Step 1: Understanding Trading**
The journey started with grasping the fundamentals of trading. We explored how trading works, the key principles, and the mechanisms behind buying and selling in financial markets. To build a strong foundation, we completed several trading courses to ensure we understood the complexities of the domain.

2️⃣ **Step 2: Developing a Machine Learning Model**
We gathered real-time trading data from MetaTrader 5 using custom commands. After processing and cleaning the data, we chose to implement a machine learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTM is a powerful neural network architecture, especially effective for sequential data like market trends. We trained, tested, and refined our model to achieve the desired predictive accuracy.

3️⃣ **Step 3: Deployment**
Deployment posed the most significant challenge. We used MQL5, MetaTrader 5's programming language, to integrate our trained model. This enabled the trading robot to execute real-time trades based on the model’s predictions. Now, with just one click, the robot can automatically buy and sell assets, leveraging the results of the trained machine learning model.

**Key Features**
Real-time Trading Data: Integrated with MetaTrader 5 for live market data.
LSTM Neural Networks: Used for processing sequential trading data and making predictions.
Automated Trading: Once deployed, the robot autonomously buys and sells based on the model’s predictions.
**How to Use**
1.Clone the repository.
2.Follow the instructions in the deployment section to set up MetaTrader 5 and integrate the machine learning model.
3.With one click, start the automated trading process.
